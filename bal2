Title: Incorporating Stata into reproducible documents

Abstract
--------

Part of reproducible research is eliminating manual steps such
as hand-editing documents.  Stata 15 introduces several commands
which facilitate automated document production, including
<b>dyndoc</b> for converting dynamic Markdown documents to
web pages, <b>putdocx</b> for creating Word documents, and
<b>putpdf</b> for creating PDF files.

These commands allow you to mix formatted text and Stata
output and allow you to embed Stata graphs, in-line Stata
results, and tables containing the output from selected
Stata commands.

We will show these commands in action, demonstrating automating
the production of documents in various formats, and including Stata
results in those documents.
